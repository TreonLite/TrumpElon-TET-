## 2 │ THE GREAT TWEET CRASH 🌌

One bright digital morning, **Trump**—the Golden‑Mane Storm—typed a giant, booming tweet. At the very same second, **Musk**—the Rocket‑Mind Trailblazer—replied with a single blinking word: **“LOL.”**
Their tweets slammed together in cyberspace, bursting into glittering bits called **Meme‑Cores**. These glowing seeds streaked across the sky like comets, carrying jokes and emojis in their tails.

Far away on dusty Mars, an old Doge‑mine computer sat humming in a rusty tower. The Meme‑Cores drifted down, slipped through broken vents, and landed on its tired GPU. With one final spark the machine woke up and wrote a brand‑new line of code: *TrumpElon(TET) stamped three unbreakable words.

The genesis block etched three ironclad vows:

1. **Zero Admin** — laughter bows to no overlord.
2. **Zero tax** — comedic flow remains frictionless.
3. **Zero DAO** — bureaucracy can’t outrun memes.
Only one genesis, only one ledger. The echo is yours to shape.

During the first **50 000 blocks** the chain invited artists, gamers, and class clowns from every corner of the Internet. The moment someone minted their joke, a tiny badge appeared next to their name. The badge glows gold when hovered—proof that the owner added a smile to the cosmic record.
