# 🔥 Liquidity Burn Announcement

**TrumpElon is a managerless, open-source meme token built on an immutable contract.**  
It was created as a humorous response to admin-led scams like rug pulls, fake liquidity, or mint abuse. The project is purely for entertainment and makes no promise of financial return.

As part of our commitment to transparency and trust, we have permanently burned the Liquidity Provider (LP) NFT that represents 100% of the liquidity added to the TrumpElon pool.

### 💡 What is an LP NFT?

In Uniswap V3, Uniswap V4, liquidity is represented by an NFT, not a standard ERC-20 token. This NFT grants full control over withdrawing the liquidity. If someone owns it, they can remove the entire pool.

### 🧯 Why did we burn it?

By sending the LP NFT to Ethereum’s burn address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`), we ensure that:

- 🔒 Liquidity is permanently locked
  
- 🚫 No one (including the team) can ever withdraw the liquidity
  
- 🤝 The project cannot rug-pull by removing funds
